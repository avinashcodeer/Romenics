# Remote URL

The [`remote_url`][remote_url] plugin allows you to attach files from a remote
location.

```rb
plugin :remote_url, max_size: 20*1024*1024
```

If for example your attachment is called "avatar", this plugin will add
`#avatar_remote_url` and `#avatar_remote_url=` methods to your model.

```rb
user.avatar #=> nil
user.avatar_remote_url = "http://example.com/cool-image.png"
user.avatar #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>

user.avatar.mime_type         #=> "image/png"
user.avatar.size              #=> 43423
user.avatar.original_filename #=> "cool-image.png"
```

You can also use `#remote_url=` and `#remote_url` methods directly on the
`Shrine::Attacher`:

```rb
attacher.remote_url = "http://example.com/cool-image.png"
```

By default, the file will be downloaded using `Down.download` from the [Down]
gem. This will use the `Down::NetHttp` backend by default, which is a wrapper
around [open-uri].

## Dynamic options

You can dynamically pass options to the downloader by using
`Attacher#assign_remote_url`:

```rb
attacher.assign_remote_url(url, downloader: { 'Authorization' => 'Basic ...' })
```

You can also pass any other `Shrine#upload` options:

```rb
attacher.assign_remote_url(url, metadata: { "mime_type" => "text/plain" })
```

## Maximum size

It's a good practice to limit the maximum filesize of the remote file:

```rb
plugin :remote_url, max_size: 20*1024*1024 # 20 MB
```

Now if a file that is bigger than 20MB is assigned, download will be terminated
as soon as it gets the "Content-Length" header, or the size of currently
downloaded content surpasses the maximum size. However, if for whatever reason
you don't want to limit the maximum file size, you can set `:max_size` to nil:

```rb
plugin :remote_url, max_size: nil
```

## Custom downloader

If you want to customize how the file is downloaded, you can override the
`:downloader` parameter and provide your own implementation. For example, you
can use the [http.rb] Down backend for downloading:

```rb
# Gemfile
gem "http"
```
```rb
require "down/http"

down = Down::Http.new do |client|
  client
    .follow(max_hops: 2)
    .timeout(connect: 2, read: 2)
end

plugin :remote_url, max_size: 20*1024*1024, downloader: down.method(:download)
```

## Errors

If download errors, the error is rescued and a validation error is added equal
to the error message. You can change the default error message:

```rb
plugin :remote_url, error_message: "download failed"
plugin :remote_url, error_message: -> (url, error) { I18n.t("errors.download_failed") }
```

## Background

If you want the file to be downloaded from the URL in the background, you can
use the [shrine-url] storage which allows you to assign a custom URL as cached
file ID, and pair that with the `backgrounding` plugin.

## File extension

When attaching from a remote URL, the uploaded file location will have the
extension inferred from the URL. However, some URLs might not have an
extension, in which case the uploaded file location also won't have the
extension. If you want the upload location to always have an extension, you can
load the `infer_extension` plugin to infer it from the MIME type.

```rb
plugin :infer_extension
```

## Instrumentation

If the `instrumentation` plugin has been loaded, the `remote_url` plugin adds
instrumentation around remote URL downloading.

```rb
# instrumentation plugin needs to be loaded *before* remote_url
plugin :instrumentation
plugin :remote_url
```

Downloading remote URLs will trigger a `remote_url.shrine` event with the
following payload:

| Key                 | Description                            |
| :--                 | :----                                  |
| `:remote_url`       | The remote URL string                  |
| `:download_options` | Any download options passed in         |
| `:uploader`         | The uploader class that sent the event |

A default log subscriber is added as well which logs these events:

```
Remote URL (1550ms) â€“ {:remote_url=>"https://example.com/image.jpg",:download_options=>{},:uploader=>Shrine}
```

You can also use your own log subscriber:

```rb
plugin :remote_url, log_subscriber: -> (event) {
  Shrine.logger.info JSON.generate(name: event.name, duration: event.duration, **event.payload)
}
```
```
{"name":"remote_url","duration":5,"remote_url":"https://example.com/image.jpg","download_options":{},"uploader":"Shrine"}
```

Or disable logging altogether:

```rb
plugin :remote_url, log_subscriber: nil
```
