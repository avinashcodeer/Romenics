Shrine is a toolkit for handling file uploads in Ruby. It supports uploading,
processing and deleting IO objects, backed by a storage adapter. It uses
efficient streaming to minimize memory usage.

Shrine comes with a high-level attachment interface for attaching uploaded
files to database records, saving their location and metadata to a database
column, and tying them to record's lifecycle.
